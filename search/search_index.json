Submissions not following these guidelines are not graded. Workflow errors, i.e., not following the guidelines (e.g., not assigning the right person, or not assigning at all) are penalized. Screenshots \u00b6 Some of the exercises require you to create a screenshot. This screenshot is proof of the completion of the exercise. The expected content of these screenshots is detailed in the exercise description. The screenshot may include the entire desktop or just the required portion of the screen. The screenshots must be submitted as part of the solution code, uploaded to the git repository. The repositories are private; only you and the instructions can access them. If there is any content on the screenshot that is not relevant to the exercise and you would like to remove, you can obscure these parts. Grading \u00b6 You can earn 20+3 points for each lab. The +3 is an extra, optional task. You must submit each lab until the deadline. For successful completion, you must get at least 8 points. Grading, based on the points, is as follows: 0-7.5 point: failed 8-10.5 point: pass 11-13.5 point: satisfactory 14-16.5 point: good 17-20+ points: very good The extra +3 points are optional; if you do them, it is added to the points. In the automated evaluation, this extra 3 points will appear as \"imsc\"; please ignore this (that is for the Hungarian students). The final grade will be the mathematically correct average of the individual grades. If you do not attend a lab or do not submit it until the deadline, it will be counted as grade 1 in the average.

If there are some issues you need to diagnose, the entire log of the execution is available for you on the GitHub Actions web page. A short introduction is provided here . Our expectations regarding the labs \u00b6 Where should I upload the solution? See above. Individual work at home? Since your work is graded, you are expected to submit your own solution. This does not mean that you cannot ask or give help to others. But it prohibits submitting a work created by someone else. This is the reason we ask for screenshots: these verify the process of completing the exercises. Submitting the work of someone else: Refer to the Ethical codex and the Code of Studies. One lab is just 4 hours, right? No. This course is 3 credits, which (officially) translates to approx. 90 hours of work invested throughout the semester. The lab is not just the 4 hours you spend with the instructor; it also involves preliminary preparation and finishing/completing the tasks at home. My code contains a small typo and I received no grade. You are expected to write code that works! You are completing the exercises in front of a computer, so you have everything you need to check yourself. Your code must compile and must run. If the behavior is not entirely correct, that is accepted. But if it does not even compile, it will not be graded. Just imagine what would happen if you committed code that does not compile at your workplace? If I am working at home, how do I get help? Talk to your lab instructor. The instructor does not help. Why? You might not be given the right solution if you face a problem. But this does not mean you get no help. You are encouraged to investigate your problems, search for solutions, and ask specific issues. You must demonstrate that you are a professional! How should I ask questions then? In short: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask . In more detail: If you are stuck, first, make an effort to understand your problem. The problem is not that \"it does not work\" or \"I don't know how to do it.\" You can ask good questions once you understand the problem and have tested some solutions already. So the answer is Google and StackOverflow? No. Everything you need here, you should already know. Google is an excellent tool and StackOverflow is even better. However... You also need to understand the answer you find here. The answer you find here might be a solution to some problem, but not necessarily your issue. All these deadlines and rules! A software developer, better yet, an engineer must be prepared to write code and work within the scope of prescribed rules. The world is complex, and complexity is often managed with rules.

It is a CI system capable of running jobs on git repositories. We use this system, for example, to compile your code and test it. You will receive a notification about the results in a pull request. But if you need more details, such as check the application logs, you can access these using the web interface of GitHub under Actions . Here, you will see a list of Workflows . By selecting one (e.g., the last one is always at the top of the list), you see this workflow's details. To get to the logs you need to click once more on the left. The log will be on the right side. Each green checkmark is a successful step. These steps do not correspond to your exercises; these describe the evaluation process. These steps include preparations, such as setting up the .NET environment for compiling your code (since each workflow starts in a clean environment, these steps are performed each time). Most of these steps should be successful, even if your submission contains an error. The two exceptions when these tasks might fail due to your changes are: (1) if neptun.txt is missing, or (2) your C# code does not compile. The neptun.txt is mandatory, and no evaluation is performed until that is provided. The C# compilation is a step that must succeed; otherwise, your application cannot be started. There might be transient errors in these workflows. An example is when a download, such as the download of the .NET environment fails. The workflow execution can be repeated if this occurs. Obviously, retrying the execution may only help if the problem is indeed transient; a retry will not resolve a C# compilation error. (You can deduce the cause from the name of the step and the error message.) You might also be able to access the application logs. E.g., when testing a .NET application, it is started, and the logs will be printed here. The image below shows the initialization of an Entity Framework application, where you can also see the translated and executed SQL commands.

Each laboratory is submitted in a GitHub repository that you will create through a provided link. The solution of the laboratory exercises are created within these repositories, then committed and pushed to GitHub. The submission is finished with a pull request assigned to the laboratory instructor. IMPORTANT The submission requirements detailed below and mandatory. Submissions not following these guidelines are not graded. Short version, aka. TL;DR \u00b6 The detailed description below shows the entire procedure. This summary is an overview of the whole process. The lab exercises are solved in a dedicated GitHub repository created through a link in the exercise description. Your solution is submitted on a new branch, not on master. You can create any number of committed on this branch. You need to push these commits to GitHub. You submit your final solution through a pull request assigned to the laboratory instructor. You can ask questions regarding the results and evaluation in the pull request comment thread. To notify your instructor use the @name annotation in the comment text. Starting your work: git checkout \u00b6 Register a GitHub account if you don't have one yet. Open the link in the exercise description to create your repository. If needed, authorize the GitHub Classroom application to use your account data. (This page will be displayed the first time you click the link in the previous step.) You will see a page where you can \"Accept the ... assignment\". Click the button. Wait for the repository creation to finish. You will get the repository URL here. Note The repository will be private. No one but you and the instructor will see it. Open the repository webpage by following the link. You will need this URL, so remember it. Clone your repository. You will need the repository git URL, which you can get from the repository webpage following the Clone or download button. You may use any git client. If you do not have a favorite yet, the simplest one is GitHub Desktop . You can list your repositories in this application directly from GitHub. If you are using the console or shell, the following command performs the clone (if the git command is available): git clone <repository link> If the cloning is successful, DO NOT START WORKING YET! The solution should not be committed to the repository master branch. Instead, create a new branch with the name solution . In GitHub Desktop, use the Branch menu for creating a new one. If using the console, use the following command: git checkout -b solution Complete the exercises on this branch. You may have any number of commits and pushes. In university laboratories Before you make your first commit, check whether your name and email address are properly configured. You can check this using the following commands. git config user.name git config user.email If the values are not correct, set your name and email address with the following commands executed in the repository directory. This will set the values for the repository. (It is recommended to set the email address to the one you use with GitHub.) git config user.name \"John Doe\" git config user.email \"john@doe.org\" At home When working from at home, you may want to set the name and email address globally using the --global switch in the commands above. To commit using GitHub Desktop, first check if you are on the right branch. During the first push, the solution branch needs to be published. When adding further commits, verify the branch. You can publish the commit using the Push origin button. The little number on this button shows you how many commits need pushing. If you are using the console, use the following commands: # Check the current branch and the files modified git status # Prepares all changes for commit git add . # Commit git commit -m \"f1\" # Push the new branch (first time) git push --set-upstream origin solution # Push futher commits git push Submitting the solution \u00b6 When you are ready with the exercises, verify on the repository web page that you uploaded everything. You may need to switch branches. GitHub web file upload We recommend that you do not use the GitHub web file upload. If something is missing, add it to your local repository and commit and push again. When you are truly ready, open a pull request . Why the pull request? This pull request combines all changes you made and shows us the final result. This helps the laboratory instructor to evaluate your submission more easily. This pull request means you submit your solution; hence this step cannot be omitted . To open the pull request , you need to go to the repository's GitHub web frontend. If you pushed recently, GitHub will offer you to create the pull request. You may also open the pull request from the menu at the top. It is important to specify the correct branches: master is the target into which solution is merged. When the pull request is created, you will see a little number \"1\" on the Pull request menu showing you that there is one open item there. YOU ARE NOT FINISHED YET! The pull request will trigger a preliminary evaluation. You will see the result of this evaluation as a comment added to the pull request thread. This will be different for each laboratory. You will see the result in a comment in the pull request thread. If you need more information about the evaluation and the results, GitHub Actions can provide you more. A short introduction is provided here . If you are not satisfied with your work, you can make further changes. You only need to commit and push your changes. Any changes pushed will re-trigger the evaluation of the pull request . We ask that you trigger NO MORE THAN 5 evaluations ! Making further changes without running the evaluation If you want to make changes to your submission and not have the re-evaluation run, you should convert the pull request to draft . This state means work in progress. You can commit and push freely. These will not trigger any evaluation. Once ready, you must change the state back: go to the bottom of the PR and click \"Ready for review.\" This will set the PR back to its normal state and trigger an automated evaluation. Maximum 5 Evaluations that fail due to transient errors, such as network problems, are not counted into the 5 evaluations. But if you trigger more evaluation by mistake, or on purpose, it will be sanctioned. You are required to test your solution locally before submitting it. FINALLY , when you are ready, assign the pull request to your laboratory instructor. This step is considered as the submission of your work. Without pull request If you have no pull request, or it is not assigned to the instructor, we consider it work in progress and not submitted. Done Now you are ready. After assigning the pull request, make no further changes . The instructor will evaluate the submission and close the pull request. Questions and complaints regarding the final result \u00b6 If you have questions on concerns regarding the automated evaluation, use the pull request for communication with the instructor by asking questions via comments. To let the instructor know you have questions, please use @name mention in the PR comment. This will automatically send an email notification.

You can earn 8 points with the completion of this exercise. Open the Visual Studio solution \u00b6 Open the Visual Studio solution (the .sln ) file in the checked out repository. If Visual Studio tells you that the project is not supported, you need to install a missing component (see here ). Do NOT upgrade any version Do not upgrade the project, the .NET Core version, or any Nuget package! If you see such a question, always choose no! The solution is structured according to a multi-tier architecture: The Controllers folder has the Web Api controllers handling the REST requests. The DAL folder implements the data access; it contains a repository layer and an Entity Framework Code First data model. The Model folder contains the shared entities. In this exercise, you will need to work in classes DAL.StatusesRepository and Controllers.StatusesController . You can make changes to these classes as long as the source code complies (and the repository implements interface IStatusesRepository ). Start the web app \u00b6 Check if the web application starts. Compile the code and start in Visual Studio. Open URL http://localhost:5000/api/ping in a browser. If everything goes well, you see the response \"pong\" in the browser, and the incoming request is logged in the console. List all statuses (4p) \u00b6 Implement the first operation to list all available status entities. Open class Model.Status . This is the entity class used by the business layer. Do NOT make any changes to this class. Open class DAL.EfDbContext.DbStatus . This is the Entity Framework and database representation of the same entity. Let us implement this class: public class DbStatus { public int Id { get ; set ; } public string Name { get ; set ; } } The Id is the primary key in the database, and Name is the name of the status. Open class DAL.EfDbContext.TasksDbContext . We need to add a new DbSet property here and configure the C# - database mapping in method OnModelCreating : public class TasksDbContext : DbContext { public DbSet < DbStatus > Statuses { get ; set ; } protected override void OnModelCreating ( ModelBuilder modelBuilder ) { modelBuilder . Entity < DbStatus >() . ToTable ( \"statuses\" ); modelBuilder . Entity < DbStatus >() . HasKey ( s => s . Id ); modelBuilder . Entity < DbStatus >() . Property ( s => s . Name ). HasMaxLength ( 50 ) . IsRequired ( required : true ). IsUnicode ( unicode : true ); } } This configuration sets the name of the table in the database, the key (which will generate values automatically), and the constraints related to the name field. Go to the method DAL.StatusesRepository.List() . This is the repository layer that interacts with the database using Entity Framework. Let us list all statuses from the database: public IReadOnlyCollection < Model . Status > List () { return db . Statuses . Select ( ToModel ). ToList (); } The db variable represents our database, the DbContext, injected via the framework. We will use the helper method ToModel to translate the EF representation to the business layer representation. Let us implement this method (in the repository class). private static Model . Status ToModel ( DbStatus value ) { return new Model . Status ( value . Id , value . Name ); } Once the repository is ready, let us move to the controller. Open class Controllers.StatusesController . Add your Neptun code into the controller's URL : this controller shall respond to queries that arrive at URL /api/statuses/neptun where the last 6 characters are your Neptun code all lowercase. [Route(\"api/statuses/neptun\")] [ApiController] public class StatusesController : ControllerBase Neptun code is important The Neptun code shall appear in screenshots later. You must add it as specified above! Let us implement an endpoint for handling the GET /api/statuses/neptun request: The dependency injection is configured already; thus the constructor accepts the repository interface ( not the implementation but its interface). public class StatusesController : ControllerBase { // ... [HttpGet] public IEnumerable < Status > List () { return repository . List (); } } Compile the code and start the app. Open Postman and send a GET request to URL http://localhost:5000/api/statuses/neptun (with your Neptun code in the URL). The query is successful if Postman reports status code 200, and the result is empty. If there is an error, check the Output window in Visual Studio and the running application console window. Add some test data. Stop the application. Go to method DAL.EfDbContext.TasksDbContext.OnModelCreating and insert a few test records (also called seed data ): public class TasksDbContext : DbContext { protected override void OnModelCreating ( ModelBuilder modelBuilder ) { // ... modelBuilder . Entity < DbStatus >() . HasData ( new [] { new DbStatus () { Id = 1 , Name = \"new\" }, new DbStatus () { Id = 2 , Name = \"in progress\" }, }); } } Compile the code again, then start the application and repeat the same GET query. The response shall include the two statuses. If you do not see the status records If the seed records do not appear in the response, it is possible that the database was not updated with the HasData method. Delete the tasks.db SQLite database file; this will re-create the database when the application starts again. Generally, schema and data modification in live environments are handled using migrations . To simplify things, we will not use migrations. If the database schema is changed, just delete tasks.db . Query and insert operations (4p) \u00b6 There are a few other operations we need to implement: check existence by specifying name ( HEAD /api/statuses/neptun/{name} ), find record by ID ( GET /api/statuses/neptun/{id} ), adding a new status record ( POST /api/statuses/neptun ). Let us implement these. Let us start with the implementation of the first two in the repository. When looking for an item based on a name, we will do a case-insensitive comparison. public bool ExistsWithName ( string statusName ) { return db . Statuses . Any ( s => EF . Functions . Like ( s . Name , statusName )); } public Model . Status FindById ( int statusId ) { var dbRecord = db . Statuses . FirstOrDefault ( s => s . Id == statusId ); if ( dbRecord == null ) return null ; else return ToModel ( dbRecord ); } EF.Functions.Like helps us to write a SQL \"like\" query in Entity Framework. This will translate into the proper LIKE operator when executed. This helps us to perform case insensitive comparison. The controller endpoints for these operations are: [HttpHead(\"{statusName}\")] [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK)] [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound)] public ActionResult ExistsWithName ( string statusName ) { var exists = repository . ExistsWithName ( statusName ); if ( exists ) return Ok (); else return NotFound (); } [HttpGet(\"{id}\")] [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK)] [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound)] public ActionResult < Status > Get ( int id ) { var value = repository . FindById ( id ); if ( value == null ) return NotFound (); else return Ok ( value ); } Note the controller method attributes and return values! If the response contains data (in the http body) the return type is ActionResult<T> ; if there is no body and only a status code is returned, the return type is ActionResult . Methods Ok and NotFound help us create the correct responses. The URL is defined on two \"levels.\" We defined /api/statuses/neptun on the controller; it applies to all endpoints. It is the \"last part\" of the URL that is defined on each endpoint separately. To implement the insertion, let us start with the repository again. Insert is triggered by receiving a CreateStatus model class with a name. We would like to ensure unique names. Thus, we need to verify it before insertion. public Model . Status Insert ( CreateStatus value ) { using ( var tran = db . Database . BeginTransaction ( System . Data . IsolationLevel . RepeatableRead )) { if ( db . Statuses . Any ( s => EF . Functions . Like ( s . Name , value . Name ))) throw new ArgumentException ( \"name must be unique\" ); var toInsert = new DbStatus () { Name = value . Name }; db . Statuses . Add ( toInsert ); db . SaveChanges (); tran . Commit (); return new Model . Status ( toInsert . Id , toInsert . Name ); } } Mind the transaction! First, we check if an identical name exists. If so, an error is raised. After inserting the record, the transaction also has to be committed. Since the database assigns the ID, the repository needs to return the created entity with this assigned ID. The POST http request is handled by the following controller endpoint: [HttpPost] [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status201Created)] [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)] public ActionResult < Status > Create ([ FromBody ] Dto . CreateStatus value ) { try { var created = repository . Insert ( value ); return CreatedAtAction ( nameof ( Get ), new { id = created . Id }, created ); } catch ( ArgumentException ex ) { return BadRequest ( new { error = ex . Message }); } } Note both the successful and the failed responses. If insertion succeeded, the CreatedAtAction helper method prepares a response that contains the entity in the body and adds a Location header with the URL to fetch the record (thus the reference to nameof(Get) ). In case of failure, the exception is handled by reporting the error to the caller. The status code will be 400, and the body will indicate an explanation as text (as REST does not have other means to report errors besides status code). Compile and start the app. Test the queries! Produce both successful and erroneous responses too. SUBMISSION Create a screenshot in Postman (or an alternative tool you used) that shows a failed insert request and response. The cause of failure should be that an item with the same name already exists. Save the screenshot as f1.png and submit with the other files of the solution. The screenshot shall include both the request and the response with all details (URL, body, response code, response body). Verify that your Neptun code is visible in the URL! The screenshot is required to earn the points.","title":"Exercise 1: Managing statuses"},{"location":"Lab-EFREST/Exercise-1/#exercise-1-managing-statuses","text":"In this exercise, we will implement the basic management of status entities.

It has a unique ID , a text Title , a Done flag to signal completion, and a Status field referencing the status of this task (with 1-* multiplicity). Define the Entity Framework model first: Define the Entity Framework data model of this entity in class DAL.EfDbContext.DbTask . The referenced status should be a proper navigation property ! Add the new DbSet field to class TasksDbContext . Specify the configuration of the mapping of this entity in OnModelCreating . Make sure to configure the navigation property here correctly! Add some initial (\"seed\") data, as seen previously. Operations in the repository \u00b6 Create a new class TasksRepository in the DAL folder that implements the existing ITasksRepository interface. Implement the following operations: IReadOnlyCollection<Task> List() : lists all available tasks Task FindById(int taskId) : returns the single task with the specified ID if it exists; returns null otherwise Task Insert(CreateTask value) : adds a new task to the database with the specified title and associates it with the specified status; if no status with the provided name exists, create a new status record; the return value is the new task entity as created in the database with its assigned ID Task Delete(int taskId) : deletes the specified task; return value is the task (state before deletion), or null if the task is not found You don't need to implement the other operations yet; however, an implementation needs to be provided so that the code compiles. You may use throw new NotImplementedException(); as a placeholder for now. Tip You will need to map the database entity to the model class in the repository.

You should see the Neptune code at the bottom of the page. IMPORTANT The Neptun code is a mandatory requirement in the footer! Listing \u00b6 First, you will need a way to access the products collection from C#. Create and initialize a new variable that represents the collection in class Repository . Use the injected IMongoDatabase variable to get the collection: private readonly IMongoCollection < Entities . Product > productCollection ; public Repository ( IMongoDatabase database ) { this . productCollection = database . GetCollection < Entities . Product >( \"products\" ); } You can use productCollection to access the product records of the database from now on. Let us start by implementing ListProducts . This will require two steps: first, to query the data from the database, then transform each record to an instance of Models.Product . The query is as follows: var dbProducts = productCollection . Find ( _ => true ) // listing all products hence an empty filter . ToList (); All items are then transformed. return dbProducts . Select ( t => new Product { ID = t . ID . ToString (), Name = t . Name , Price = t . Price , InStock = t . InStock }) . ToList (); The implementation of FindProduct(string id) is similar, except for querying a single record by matching the ID . Pay attention to that fact that the ID is received as string, but it needs converting to ObjectId . The transformation to the model remains identical. However, we should also handle when there is no matching record found and return a null value in this case (without converting anything to a model). The query is as follows: var dbProduct = productCollection . Find ( t => t . ID == ObjectId . Parse ( id )) . SingleOrDefault (); // ... model conversion Note how the filter expression looks like! Also, note how the ToList is replaced with a SingleOrDefault call. This returns either the first (and single) element in the result set or null when there is none. This is a generic way of querying a single record from the database. You will need to write a similar code in further exercises. The conversion/transformation code is already given; however, we should prepare to handle when dbProduct is null . Instead of conversion, we should just return null then. Test the behavior of these queries! Start the web application and go to http://localhost:5000 in a browser. Click Products to list the data from the database. If you click on Details it will show the details of the selected product. If you do not see any product If you see no items on this page, but there is no error, it is most likely due to a misconfigured database access. MongoDB will not return an error if the specified database does not exist. See the instructions for changing the connection details above. Creation \u00b6 Implement the method InsertProduct(Product product) . The input is an instance of Models.Product that collects the information specified on the UI. To create a new product, we will first create a new database entity (in memory first). This is an instance of class Entities.Product . There is no need to set the ID - the database will generate it. Name , Price and Stock are provided by the user. What is left is VAT and CategoryID . We should just hard-code values here: create a new VAT entity and find a random category using Robo3T and copy the _id value. var dbProduct = new Entities . Product { Name = product . Name , Price = product . Price , Stock = product . Stock , VAT = new Entities . VAT { Name = \"General\" , Percentage = 20 }, CategoryID = ObjectId . Parse ( \"5d7e4370cffa8e1030fd2d99\" ), }; // ... insertion Once the database entity is ready use InsertOne to add it to the database. To test your code, start the application and click the Add new product link on the products page. You will need to fill the necessary data, and then the presentation layer will call your code. Delete \u00b6 Implement method DeleteProduct(string id) . Use DeleteOne on the collection to delete the record. You will need a filter expression here to find the matching record similarly to how it was done in FindProduct(string id) . Test the functionality using the web application by clicking the Delete link next to a product. Modification \u00b6 We will implement the method bool SellProduct(string id, int amount) as a modification operation. The method shall return true if a record with a matching id is found, and there are at least amount pieces in stock. If the product is not found or there is not enough in stock return false . Using the atomicity guarantees of MongoDB, we will perform the changes in a single step. A filter will be used to find both the id and check if there are enough items in stock. A modification will decrease the stock only if the filter is matched. var result = productCollection . UpdateOne ( filter : t => t . ID == ObjectId . Parse ( id ) && t . Stock >= amount , update : Builders < Entities . Product >. Update . Inc ( t => t . Stock , - amount ), options : new UpdateOptions { IsUpsert = false }); Note that the UpdateOptions is used to signal that we do NOT want as upsert operation; instead, we want the operation to do nothing when the filter is not matched. The modification is assembled using Update in Builders . Here we want to decrease the stock value with amount (which is effectively and increase with -amount ). We can determine what happened based on the result returned by the update operation. If the result indicates that the filter matched a record and the modification was performed, return true . Otherwise, return false . return result . MatchedCount > 0 ; Test the functionality using the web application by clicking the Buy link next to a product.

We will be listing available categories here with the number of products in each category. We will need an aggregation pipeline here. Continue working in class MongoLabor.DAL.Repository . The method you should implement is IList<Category> ListCategories() . The method shall return all categories. Class Models.Category has 3 members. Name : the name of the category ParentCategoryName : the name of the parent category. If there is no parent, the value should be null . NumberOfProducts : number of products in this category. If there are no products, the value should be 0 . The outline of the solution is as follows. Create and initialize a new productCollection similar to how categoryCollection is initialized. The name of the collection is categories - you can verify this using Robo3T . ListCategories() should first query all categories. Perform this similarly to how it was done in the previous exercise. Store the result set in variable dbCategories . Query the number of products associated with each category ( Product.CategoryID ). Use an aggregation pipeline and a $group step as follows. var productCounts = productCollection . Aggregate () . Group ( t => t . CategoryID , g => new { CategoryID = g . Key , NumberOfProducts = g . Count () }) . ToList (); This query yields a list where each item has a CategoryID and the number of associated products. We have all information we need: all categories (including the parents) and the number of products for each. The final step is to \"merge\" the results in C# code. return dbCategories . Select ( c => { string parentCategoryName = null ; if ( c . ParentCategoryID . HasValue ) parentCategoryName = dbCategories . Single ( p => p . ID == c . ParentCategoryID . Value ).

This is not the only solution to \"join\" collections in MongoDB. Although there is no join operation, there are ways to query data across collections. Instead of doing this in MongoDB, we do the merging in C# as above. This would not be good if the data set was large. Also, if there was filtering involved, the code above would be much more complicated. Use the Categories link of the website to test your solution. This will list the data provided by your code in a tabular format. You can use the Add new product functionality from before to create new products.

We have all information we need: all categories (including the parents) and the number of products for each. The final step is to \"merge\" the results in C# code. return dbCategories . Select ( c => { string parentCategoryName = null ; if ( c . ParentCategoryID . HasValue ) parentCategoryName = dbCategories . Single ( p => p . ID == c . ParentCategoryID . Value ). Name ; var numProd = productCounts . SingleOrDefault ( pc => pc . CategoryID == c . ID )?. NumberOfProducts ?? 0 ; return new Category { Name = c . Name , ParentCategoryName = parentCategoryName , NumberOfProducts = numProd }; }) . ToList (); As seen above, this is performed using LINQ. This is not the only solution to \"join\" collections in MongoDB. Although there is no join operation, there are ways to query data across collections. Instead of doing this in MongoDB, we do the merging in C# as above. This would not be good if the data set was large. Also, if there was filtering involved, the code above would be much more complicated. Use the Categories link of the website to test your solution. This will list the data provided by your code in a tabular format. You can use the Add new product functionality from before to create new products. This must result in an increase in the number of products in one of the categories. (Remember that inserting the product hard-coded a category ID.)

Even though the solutions are provided below, you are required to execute the queries, get the execution plan, think about it, and document it. If the query plan or the explanation of subsequent exercises is the same, or at least very similar, it is enough to document everything once (one screenshot and one explanation); and list which (sub)exercises it is the solution for. Exercise 1 (2p) \u00b6 Drop the CustomerSite => Customer foreign key and the Customer table primary key constraint. Find these in the Object Explorer and delete them (the PK... is the primary key while the FK... is the foreign key - the ones you need to delete are in two different tables!): Execute the following queries on the Customer table and examine the execution plans (always fetch the entire records using select * ): a) query the whole table b) get one record based on primary key c) querying records where the primary key is not a specified constant (use the <> comparison operation for not equals) d) querying records where the primary key is greater than a specified constant e) querying records where the primary key is greater than a specified constant, ordering by ID descending Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan! Solution The SQL queries : a) select * from customer b) select * from customer where id = 1 c) select * from customer where id <> 1 d) select * from customer where id > 1 e) select * from customer where id > 1 order by id desc a)-d) The execution plan is indentical for all, it uses a table scan each time: Explanation : the optimizer cannot use any index, as there is none, thus there is no other choice but to use a table scan . e) This one is a little different due to the order by there is a sort stage too. Explanation : The table scan is the same, and after that, there is still a need for sorting - without any index it is a separate stage. Exercise 2 (2p) \u00b6 Re-create the primary key of the Customer table: Right-click the table > Design > then right-click the ID column \"Set Primary Key \" then Save, or execute ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Customer] ADD PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([ID] ASC) Re-run the same queries as in the previous exercise. What do you experience? Solution The commands are the same as before. a) The Clustered Index Scan iterates the table. We have a Clustered Index automatically created for the primary key, which has the records sorted by ID. By iterating through this index, all records are visited. This is almost identical to a Table Scan though, not efficient. However, this is what we asked for here. b) A Clustered Index Seek is enough. Since the filter criteria is for the ID, for which there is an index available, the matching record can be found quickly. This is an efficient plan, the Clustered Index is used for the exact purpose we created it for. c) Similar to the previous one, a Clustered Index Seek between two intervals ( < constant , > constant ). Since the filter criteria still references the ID field with a Clustered Index, the query will use this index. This is an efficient query. d) Very similar to the previous one with a range filter. e) Clustered Index Seek with a backward seek order. The Properties window shows the Seek Order-t: find the last matching record, and walk the index backwards, which will yield a sorted result set. Exercise 3 (2p) \u00b6 Execute the following queries on the Product table. f) query the whole table g) search for specific records where Price equals a value h) query records where Price is not a specified constant (<>) i) query records where Price is greater than a value j) query records where Price is greater than a value, ordered by Price descending Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan! Solution The SQL commands : f) select * from product g) select * from product where price = 800 h) select * from product where price <> 800 i) select * from product where price > 800 j) select * from product where price > 800 order by price desc f)-i) A Clustered Index Scan iterates through the contents of the index. This is still equal to reading the entire table, since there is no index to match the filter criteria. Although a Clusterd Index is used, it does not serve any purpose in filtering; all records are visited and the filter is evaluated for each. These are not efficient queries, as the existing index is of no use. j) Still a Clustered Index Scan, but what is interesting is that cost of the sorting stage is quite large. Even after executing a costly Index Scan, we still have a further sorting to do. A good index would help, but there is no index for the sorted column. Exercise 4 (2p) \u00b6 Add a new non-clustered index on column Price . How do the execution plans change? To add the index use Object Explorer , find the table, expand it and right-click Indexes -> New index > Non-Clustered Index... Indices should have meaningful names, e.g., IX_Tablename_Fieldname . Add Price column to the Index key columns list. Repeat the queries from the previous exercise and explain the plans! Solution The SQL command are the same as in the previous exercise. f) Despite the new index it is still an Index Scan - since we asked for the contents of the entire table. g)-i) Clustered Index Scan iterating through the entire table, just as if there was no index available for the filtered column. Why does it not use the new index? The reason is the projection, that is, we query the entire record. The NonClustered Index could yield a set of record identifiers, after which, the records themselves would still need to be queried. The optimizer decides that it is not worth doing so, an Index Scan is more efficient. j) The NonClustered Index Seek yields keys, which are looked up in the Clustered Index, just like joining the two indices. We would have expected something similar is the previous queries too. The Clustered Index is needed as entire records are fetched, the NonClustered Index only provides references. However, these references are in the right order, the NonClustered Index provides this; so after the lookup in the Clustered Index there is no further need to do the sorting. If only the Clustered Index was used (Clustered Index Scan), the sorting would have to be performed in a separate stage. This is an acceptable query, as the NonClustered Index helps in avoiding a costly sorting step. Exercise 5 (2p) \u00b6 Generate new records into the Product table with the script below. How do the execution plans change? When repeating the query for sub-exercise i), choose a constant value that will yield few resulting records, then choose a value that returns almost all records. Explain the differences! SELECT TOP ( 1000000 ) n = ABS ( CHECKSUM ( NEWID ())) INTO dbo . Numbers FROM sys . all_objects AS s1 CROSS JOIN sys . all_objects AS s2 OPTION ( MAXDOP 1 ); CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX n ON dbo . Numbers ( n ) ; INSERT INTO Product ( Name , Price , Stock , VATID , CategoryID ) SELECT 'Apple' , n % 50000 , n % 100 , 3 , 13 FROM Numbers Solution The SQL commands are the same. f) Same as before. g) References from the NonClustered Index Seek are looked up in the Clustered Index, just like joining the two indices. Let us compare this plan to the one from before having a smaller table. Why is the Clustered Index Scan not used now? In case of larger tables the selectivity (i.e., how many records match the filtering) is more important, hence the use of the NonClustered Index. The Clustered Index Scan would be too costly in a large table. The NonClustered Index can reduce the amount of records, hence its role here. Based on the statistics of the Price column, it can be derived that the = operator will match few records. Important! Just because it is an = comparison, it does not directly follow, that there are few matches; just imagine the column having the same value is all records. Hence the need for the statistics! This is an acceptable query. Since the filtering reduces the amount of records, it is worth using the index. h) Clustered Index Scan as before. Why the difference compared to the previous case? If the = operator yields few matches, then <> will yield many. This is derived from the statistics too. So no use in doing the same as in the previous case,; a Clustered Index Scan is probably more efficient. i) The plan depends on the constant. If it yields few matches, similar to g); otherwise the same as in h). j) Just like for g). Does the order by desc matter here? The optimizer tries to avoid sorting, and this is the only way to do so. This is an acceptable plan; by using the NonClustered Index there is no separate sorting stage.","title":"Exercises solved together"},{"location":"Lab-QueryOptimization/Exercise-1/#exercises-solved-together","text":"SUBMISSION The submission shall be a documentation written in the README.md file: document the SQL commands (if the exercise tells you to), a screenshot of the query plan (just the plan and not the entire desktop!), and an explanation: what do you see on the query plan and why the system chose this option.

What do you experience? Solution The commands are the same as before. a) The Clustered Index Scan iterates the table. We have a Clustered Index automatically created for the primary key, which has the records sorted by ID. By iterating through this index, all records are visited. This is almost identical to a Table Scan though, not efficient. However, this is what we asked for here. b) A Clustered Index Seek is enough. Since the filter criteria is for the ID, for which there is an index available, the matching record can be found quickly. This is an efficient plan, the Clustered Index is used for the exact purpose we created it for. c) Similar to the previous one, a Clustered Index Seek between two intervals ( < constant , > constant ). Since the filter criteria still references the ID field with a Clustered Index, the query will use this index. This is an efficient query. d) Very similar to the previous one with a range filter. e) Clustered Index Seek with a backward seek order.

This is still equal to reading the entire table, since there is no index to match the filter criteria. Although a Clusterd Index is used, it does not serve any purpose in filtering; all records are visited and the filter is evaluated for each. These are not efficient queries, as the existing index is of no use. j) Still a Clustered Index Scan, but what is interesting is that cost of the sorting stage is quite large.

In the checked-out repository locate file reportserver.sln and open it with Visual Studio. This is an empty Report Server project. The Report Server project consists mainly of Report Definition (.rdl) files, that define the data sources (queries) and a template, which, when rendered, produces the final result: a report. These reports can be installed to a Report Server and executed there, providing the users with up-to-date data. In this lab, we will not use the Report Server. This is mainly because the configuration would require administrative privileges that we do not have in the labs. Therefore, we will preview the reports in Visual Studio. Create the first Report Definition file \u00b6 In the Solution Explorer right-click Reports and choose Add > New Item . Choose the Report type from among the listed templates. Call it Sales Orders.rdl , then click Add. If adding the new report file fails In certain Visual Studio and Report Server project versions adding this new report file might fail. If this happens, follow these steps instead. Download this empty rdl file . 1.Save the ile with the right name to the reportserver folder of your repository (this folder already exist). In Visual Studio right click Reports then choose Add > Existing Item , and browse for this file. Open the report file to get the Report Designer view. Here, the new .rdl file is displayed in the Design view. This is our development view. The Report Designer has two views: Design and Preview . A panel called Report Data (on the left) is also opened. Here, we can define data sources. If the data sources are set, we can create the report on the Design tab and check how it would look like on the Preview tab. Configuring the data source \u00b6 A data source defines where our data comes from. This will be the SQL Server database created before. Using the Report Data pane, click New > Data Source .

Then re-open the Data Source settings from the Report Data panel by right-clicking on the newly created data source, opening its properties, and then going to the Credentials page. The following checkbox has to be checked: Configuring a data set \u00b6 The next step is the configuration of a dataset. Practically, this means executing a query in the database. Using the Report Data pane, click New > Data Set . Call the dataset \"AdventureWorksDataset.\" Select the data source created before from the dropdown, then apply the following settings: Copy the following query. SELECT soh . OrderDate AS [ Date ], soh . SalesOrderNumber AS [ Order ], pps . Name AS Subcat , pp . Name as Product , SUM ( sd . OrderQty ) AS Qty , SUM ( sd . LineTotal ) AS LineTotal FROM Sales .

We will not use it, but it is available. Click OK to close the dialog. Table report (5p) \u00b6 Now that we have our connection to the database and the query that will supply the data, let us create a report. A report is basically data from the database displayed in a table or with diagrams. Open the Toolbox pane. You can do this from the View menu. From the Toolbox choose Table and draw a table on the big, empty and white canvas on the Design tab: Switch back to the Report Data pane and expand the AdventureWorksDataset: If the node is empty or cannot be opened, you need to re-open the data set properties using right click, then clicking the Refresh Fields button. Drag the Date field to the first column of the table. It should look like this: The [Date] in the second row shows the expression to evaluate, while \"Date\" in the first row is the literal header label - we can change it too. Similarly, add Order and Product to the second and third columns. Add Qty as well: drag it to the right side of the last column; the cursor icon will change to + sign, and a blue line at the end of the table will appear. This will add a new, fourth column. Add LineTotal similarly into the fifth column. The first report is almost ready. Let us check how it looks like using the Preview tab. Note that it might take a while for it to open the first time. It will be faster the second time. Verify that your Neptun code appears in the table content! (If not, you forgot a preparation step. Go back, and repeat the steps!) We can print or export the report into various formats (e.g., Word, Excel, PDF). However, this report is not very pretty, e.g., the currency is not displayed, and the Qty and date columns are not formatted, etc. Go back to Design tab, right-click the [Date] expression and select Text Box Properties. Navigate to the Number page, select the Date category , and choose a date format you like. Right-click [LineTotal] , use Text Box Properties again, and select the Currency option in Number . By moving the mouse over the gray boxes at the top of the table header, the cursor changes to resize mode. (Just like you would resize a table in Word.) Use this to resize the entire table, and the columns ( Qty and Line Total can be narrower, while the others might need more space). Finally, emphasize the header row. Select the whole row (by clicking the gray rectangle on the left end of the row) and click Bold on the ribbon.

Grouping and total value (5p) \u00b6 The report we created is very long, and it contains everything without structure. These are retail sales information: the amount of products sold each day. Let us group the data. Go back to Design tab. Make sure that we see the Row Groups pane below the table. If it is not there, right-click the design area and select Grouping in the View menu. Drag the Date field from Report Data to the Row Groups pane above the (Details) row. The table will look like this: Drag field Order into Row Groups between Date and (Details) . Now there are duplicate columns in the table. Let us delete these. Select the rightmost Date and Order columns by clicking on the gray boxes above them. Delete them by right click and Delete Columns . Unfortunately, the new Date column format is now lost, but you can set it again as previously. Check the Preview now, and see that the table is now ordered and grouped as we specified it. Go back to the Design view. Right-click the [LineTotal] cell and click Add Total . This will add a total for each Order (which we used for grouping). There will be no label added to this line. Add one by left-clicking the cell and typing: \"Order Total.\" Holding the CTRL key pressed down, click Order Total , and the two cells to the right to select them all. Then set a background color by choosing one from the Format menu. Check the preview of the report now. Let us create a daily total as well! Go back to the Design view. Right-click on the [Order] cell and click Add Total > After . A new cell (Total) appears below [Order] . Click in it and change the label to \"Daily Total\u201d. Select the cell and the three right next to it (e.g., by using CTRL and clicking them) and change their background color ( Format > Background color ). Since there are quite a few orders per day, you may need to scroll down 4-5 pages to check the result in the preview: SUBMISSION Create a screenshot of the report preview page.
